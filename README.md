ESP32NOW! based VR finger trakker used with Vive trakker

code is offered "as is" This project is on hold until summer '19 if not otherwise stated. 

Works on two ESP32-Wrooms. Other one reads the fingers and transmittes the data via ESPNOW! link to other ESP32 that resieves the data and pushes it to serial. 

This was  the result of Koodikarpat.com 2018 - a technological   summer school project meant for teens from 15 to 17 years old.

One of our projects was to design ,3D-print and play test new type controllers for VR. We manage to develop our own finger tracker in little over 2 weeks.

The team consists of students learning 3D designing ,3D printing,ESP/arduino coding,unity game developing and electronic designing .

The glove uses combination of Flex sensors,ESP32, ESPNow for wireless datalink and 18650 for power. and Vive Tracker for positional tracking of course.

The tracking is very responsive. There are no lag to see in vr. And of course only 2 fingers at the moment.

This was of course heavily inspired by u/jimmygray_ and others alike work with similar kind of devises.
